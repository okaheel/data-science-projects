Information on each project:

### Board Game reviews

Board Game Review Prediction – The goal of this project was to analyze and learn more about the reviews that were submitted for board games and to predict the average rating based on multiple factors using a Linear Regression and a Random Forest Regressor

### BOW-TFIDF

This is the implementation of a Bag of Words (BOW) Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) model. The metric of TFIDF is a metric that measures how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. This was my implementation before making it into an api to deploy on NCAR EOL’s DASH search system

### Breast Cancer Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The goal of this project is to classify tumors in malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using features obtained from several cell images via a Support Vector Machine algorithm . Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection and Analysis

The goal of this project was to detect credit card fraud using an Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to find the percentage of fraudulent transactions and to find the best model to be used to classify these transactions by analyzing the accuracy and confusion matrix of each model

### Keywords

This is the implementation of a keyword extraction tool that was built for EOL’s DASH system to help with backend data management. This was designed to take in titles and descriptions of scientific data sets and return relevant keywords that can be used for search and other discovery methods

### POS Tagger

Implementation of a Part of Speech tagger for Keyword filtering to help with identifying important keywords for DASH using NLTK

### Plotting Analytics 
The goal of this project was to analyze the iris dataset and find patterns using various lots and K means clustering and a quick analysis of US births data as a time series to understand when births peak relative to holidays in the US

### Dataset Reccomender
