Information on each project:

### BOW-TFIDF

This is the implementation of a Bag of Words (BOW) Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) model. The metric of TFIDF is a metric that measures how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. This was my implementation before making it into an API to deploy for support on NCAR EOL’s DASH search system

### Board Game reviews

Board Game Review Prediction – The goal of this project was to analyze and learn more about the reviews that were submitted for board games and to predict the average rating based on multiple factors using a Linear Regression and a Random Forest Regressor
